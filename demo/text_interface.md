Provides a more general interface. Lets you execute all of the other functionalities on a ciphertext. Features several "commands" allowing you to change/query properties. Usage might look like this:

    Anything prefixed with a ! will be considered a command. Anything else will be
    interpreted as a series of substitutions to make. The available commands are as
    follows:
    !frequency|freq|f  - Display frequencies
    !doubles|pairs|d   - Show repeating adjacent identical pairs
    !runs|r            - Display frequently repeating runs
    !delete|remove|x   - Remove letters from the subtable
    !print|p           - Show the subbed source
    !source|s          - Show the source
    !table|t           - Show the subtable
    !general|g         - Show some general info (source, table, subbed source)
    !reset|clear|c     - Reset (clear) the subtable
    !help|h            - Show help message
    !exit|quit|q       - Exit the program
    A command can be given arguments, as space-separated words after the command.

    maryam,
    it is great to hear from you. we did pick up some chatter a couple of months ago and E was mentioned there too, so we already have a file on her. her name is Eodie and she works as liaison between the british library and the british museum, researching links between artefacts and imperial roman teSts, so that ties in with the intelligence you have been receiving. nothing suggests that she has been involved in anything shady and she has helped with several insurance fraud cases. she has an interesting background. she did a phd on human migration studies, mainly mathematical modelling, then moved on to study knowledge migration which got her into the bibliophile circuit. after graduating she spent some time with one of the london auction houses working on provenance before taking her current position with the library. there really is nothing suspicious in her background and i was inclined to write her off as a lead, but when i got your message i decided i wanted to meet her. i tried to set that up only to be told that she is out of country for a while. in cairo.
    i will see you there.
