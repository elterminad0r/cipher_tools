documentation

- update docs regarding !freq

- more poly based arithmetic

- Identify a simple transposition cipher because letter frequency (broadly) matches expected letter frequency 
- Identify likely playfair because there are no double letter diagrams
- Anagramming to deal with transposition ciphers
- Calculation of index of coincidence for different groupings of the text to find likely key length for polyalphabetic ciphers
- Split polyalphabetic text into groups based on key length to allow different frequency analysis/substitution for each
- Polybius square fun for ADFGVX, nihilist, bifid....
- Substitution of double letters and integers for single letters (ADFGVX, nihilist, bifid...)
- Function to deal with playfair table and rules (?)
- Autokey identification (?)
- One-time pad using previous plaintext as a key (if they feel really sadistic)
