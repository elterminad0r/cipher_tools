bruteforce approach

gui?

- Identify likely playfair because there are no double letter diagrams
- Anagramming to deal with transposition ciphers
- Polybius square fun for ADFGVX, nihilist, bifid....

polybius utility?

- Substitution of double letters and integers for single letters (ADFGVX, nihilist, bifid...)
- Function to deal with playfair table and rules (?)
- Autokey identification (?)

betting on this
- One-time pad using previous plaintext as a key (if they feel really sadistic)

"stijn encryption"

**TODO: add mutable class for use with namedtuple

possibly look at RSA encyrption
