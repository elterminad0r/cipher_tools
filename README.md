# cipher\_tools
A collection of programs to aid in cipher-cracking. If you use this and you're not a GW appreciator you're a disappointment and need to re-evaluate your life (beware as `eval` is unsafe).

These are, as it stands, text-based interfaces. Hopefully it should be possible to paste in input. They rely on an installation of Python 3 (I recommend 3.6). They might be runnable by clicking the script from a file explorer?

You can obtain the scripts by downloading them, pasting them in, or even cloning them if you're feeling really enthusiastic. (NB the scripts are all in the `src` directory.)

View the md files in the `demo` directory for guidance on each program so far.

More comments, tweaks and even programs such as
 - Improve the general interface, and add more features
 - Finding similar repeating substring
 - It's also all very alpha-oriented atm. I'd like to add some extension supporting ciphers on spaces, etc.
 - Improve the `demo` md files
 - and more

still to come. Stay tuned.
