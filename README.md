# cipher\_tools
A collection of programs to aid in cipher-cracking/cryptanalysis. If you use this and you're not a GW appreciator you're a disappointment and need to re-evaluate your life (beware as `eval` is unsafe).

These are, as it stands, text-based interfaces. Hopefully it should be possible to paste in input. They rely on an installation of Python 3 (I recommend 3.6). They might be runnable by clicking the script from a file explorer?

You can obtain the scripts by downloading them, pasting them in, or even cloning them if you're feeling really enthusiastic. (NB the scripts are all in the `src` directory.)

Here is a quick guide to installation and execution:

 - Install Python 3.6 and, by extension, Idle from https://www.python.org/downloads/. This should be pretty well documented across the web.
 - Download this repository (click Clone or download, and then "Download ZIP"). You will probably need to unzip it. Don't make any changes to the files.
 - Navigate to `src/` in the repository in the file explorer of your choice
 - Click/double click on `text_interface.py` to run it.

If you're a command line user, you can safely ignore and just clone and pull, and run `text_interface` from the CLI.

(NB the following two MD files are currently out of date)

For more on how `text_interface.py` works, see [this](https://github.com/elterminad0r/cipher_tools/blob/master/text_interface_doc.md) MD file.

For documentation on each function, see [this](https://github.com/elterminad0r/cipher_tools/blob/master/action_doc.md) MD file.

You can also try looking at the source files in `src` - they're now pretty well documented inline. This will be more technical, terse, and may require some knowledge of Python but is guaranteed to be up to date.

At this point I would rate the whole affair as borderline operational. However, it's still woefully unprepared for anything but a simple substitution cipher. This is something I'm working on.
